		Polly as an Analysis Pass in LLVM - GSoC 2016
	</h1>
	
	Abstract:<br />  
	<p>
	The Polyhedral framework provides an exact dependence analysis, which is more powerful than conventional dependence testing algorithms [5, 6]. Currently, LLVM mainline lacks a powerful dependence analysis framework, and at the same time, Pollyâ€™s (a high level data locality optimizer based on polyhedral framework) dependence analysis is suitable for many transformation passes in LLVM like Loop Vectorization, Loop Versioning, Modulo Scheduling, Loop Nest Optimizations, etc. I propose to provide an API for Polly such that its precise dependence analysis can be used as an Analysis pass within LLVM's transformation passes.
