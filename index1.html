<h1>
Polly as an Analysis Pass in LLVM - GSoC 2016
</h1>
<p id="abstract">
Abstract:<br/>
The Polyhedral framework provides an exact dependence analysis, which is more powerful than conventional dependence testing algorithms [5, 6]. Currently, LLVM mainline lacks a powerful dependence analysis framework, and at the same time, Pollyâ€™s (a high level data locality optimizer based on polyhedral framework) dependence analysis is suitable for many transformation passes in LLVM like Loop Vectorization, Loop Versioning, Modulo Scheduling, Loop Nest Optimizations, etc. I propose to provide an API for Polly such that its precise dependence analysis can be used as an Analysis pass within LLVM's transformation passes.
